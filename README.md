## Overview

Windbnb is a simple clone of airbnb website and is only frontend for now. Created using React and Redux.

- You can find live demo on [Netlify](https://windbnb-319.netlify.app/)
- I had a good experience and learnt a lot of things from this project
- I revamped my Redux skills with the improved workflows of Redux Toolkit with React. Further, this is the first project where I have used Test Driven Development.
- Having well guided tests from user stories is really helpful to structure a project.

### Built With


- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
